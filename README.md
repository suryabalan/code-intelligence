## Approach for Code Insights and Reviews

In order to streamline the process of getting feedback and insights for recent changes in the codebase, we follow an approach where we focus on specific, impacted areas of the project rather than indexing the entire codebase. This allows us to receive more precise recommendations and improvements for specific modules and changes, optimizing the workflow and ensuring efficient testing.

### Steps for Getting Targeted Insights:

1. **Code Snippets or Diff Files**:
   - Instead of sharing the entire codebase, we provide specific **code snippets** or **diff files** that highlight the areas where changes have been made. This ensures that only the impacted sections are reviewed, allowing for more focused and efficient testing.

2. **Module Summaries**:
   - We summarize the **modules** impacted by the changes. Each module's functionality is briefly described, followed by the specific changes made. This summary helps testers understand the context of the modifications and assess the areas that need to be tested thoroughly.

3. **Request for Specific Insights**:
   - We ask targeted questions about the affected modules. This includes inquiries on **best practices**, **design improvements**, **performance optimizations**, or **integration strategies**. By focusing the feedback on specific issues, we can improve key parts of the project efficiently and ensure that the impacted areas are properly tested.

4. **Code Review Approach**:
   - We adopt a **code review** style where pieces of modified code are shared for review and feedback. This allows for a more focused analysis and enables us to get actionable advice on improving the affected sections, especially related to test coverage and edge case handling.

5. **Refactoring and Design Feedback**:
   - We specifically request suggestions on **refactoring** opportunities or **design improvements** based on changes made to services, controllers, or any other core components. This helps maintain a high level of code quality and ensures that the impacted areas are robustly tested in the process.

By following this structured approach, we ensure that feedback is targeted, actionable, and relevant to the parts of the project that need it most. This method optimizes the testing of impacted areas, avoiding unnecessary overhead and making the process more efficient.
